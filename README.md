# WISECOW
In this project i have deployed wise-cow application on aws-eks with the help of github-Actions
for TLS i have used cert-manager we can also create custom private certificates but since i don't have a domain or sub-domain so i was unable to issue the certificate.
both the scripts for cpu,disk usage alert and uptime check are mentioned above
